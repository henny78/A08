            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization run by an all-volunteer board of directors. 
               Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, 
               educate, and entertain our audience! As one of our members told us:</p>
            <blockquote>
                &ldquo;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. 
                I think of it as the gift of knowledge... and that is priceless.&rdquo;
            </blockquote>
